 ### Domain Name Variation Techniques
 
  - ## Hyphenation: 
  A hyphen (or additional hyphen) is added to the actual domain.
        A familiar-looking domain with an added hyphen could fool an uneducated user during a phishing attack.
   - ## Repetition: 
   A single vowel or consonant from the actual domain is repeated consecutively.
        Hackers often buy such domains for cybersquatting, or more specifically, for typosquatting purposes. An uneducated user   could overlook this double letter during a phishing attack, or anyone could accidentally "typo" their way to a malicious website.
   
   - ## Replacement:
   A single vowel, consonant, or number from your domain is replaced with a different letter.  
    - ## Omission:
    A single vowel or consonant from your domain is omitted or excluded.
    - ## Transposition:
    Two letters or numbers from your domain are switched in placement, and all other characters are in the appropriate position.
    - ## Bitsquatting: 
    These domains use character replacements based on characters that are one "bit" (i.e., 0 or 1) apart when the domain is translated into the binary language used by computers.
        This attack method consists of buying domains that are likely to be a result of a random memory error, causing a computer to make a binary "typo" during the DNS lookup.
            For example, KnowBe4 in binary is:
            01001011 01101110 01101111 01110111 01000010 01100101 00110100
            while CnowBe4 in binary is: 
            01000011 01101110 01101111 01110111 01000010 01100101 00110100
            These examples are only one bit apart in binary language. Therefore, a hacker may buy Cnowbe4.com for the potential  of a bitsquatting attack.
    - ## Insertion: 
    An additional number or letter is added somewhere within your domain.
   
   - ## Vowel-swap: 
   A vowel existing in your domain is replaced with a different vowel.
    
  - ## Addition: 
  An additional letter is added to the end of your domain name. 
   
  - ## Subdomain:
  Your domain is broken by a period, creating an entirely new domain.
        To the inattentive or untrained eye, this could appear to be a subdomain of your real domain.     
    - ## Homoglyph: 
    Using foreign characters to spell seemingly recognizable domains. Punycode is the system used to convert characters that can't be written in ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) into an ASCII encoding.
        These foreign characters can look very similar to letters in the English alphabet. When hovering over a URL, some browsers do not display these foreign characters as their English equivalent; therefore, further masking these unfamiliar characters.
